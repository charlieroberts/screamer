const intro = `<p>Welcome to <i>screamer</i>, a ive-coding language for strange art. A screamer is a sped-up circus march composed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamer_(march)" target=_blank>"to stir audiences into a frenzy"</a>; this language uses a technique called raymarching to render graphical oddities.</p>

<p>Coding on this site targets desktops, but mobile users can
click through demos using the "Next Demo >>" button in 
the top right corner (this button is only available
on mobile, desktop users can hit alt+l). Adventurous mobile users
can also evaluate code using the $ key, or normal key
combos if you have an external keyboard connected to your mobile device.</p>

<p>Key commands are as follows (replace "alt" key with "option"
key in macOS):</p>

<ul>
<li><pre>alt + l</pre> loads the next demo
<li><pre>ctrl + enter</pre> executes a line
<li><pre>alt + enter</pre> executes a block
<li><pre>shift + enter</pre> executes a block and resets default config
<li><pre>ctrl + .</pre> clears the scene
<li><pre>alt + c</pre> enables WASD + arrow keys camera control
</ul>
